After seeing others like *Haskell Live*[^1] or *Tetrix in Scala*[^2], I decided to give it a try.\r\n\r\nI decided to focus on a game I just recently learned: Shogi.\r\n\r\nShogi is often described as japanese chess, but in my opinion is is a totally different game.\r\nBasic info on the game can be found at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi).\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n----------\r\nThe objectives are still unclear, but I have some things in mind for this game simulator:\r\n\r\n- Provide a console interface to play the game against another player.\r\n- Load and save capabilities in order to replay or resume games, using a [standard notation](http://www.japanesechess.net/psn/).\r\n- GUI\r\n\r\nI may decide, at a later point, to use the [Universal Shogi Interface](http://www.glaurungchess.com/shogi/usi.html).\r\n\r\nSome things are also on my wontdo list:\r\n\r\n- Gaming AI. I am still a newbie in this game, and while I understand the rules, I cannot make a decent AI.\r\n\r\n\r\n[^1]: http://haskelllive.com\r\n\r\n[^2]: http://eed3si9n.com/\r\n","google":"","name":"Hsogi"}
